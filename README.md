# JDIexample
try to imitate other's JDI, and then it may add personal functions.

## how to run it?
To test JDIExampleDebugger.java if it is debugging JDIExampleDebuggee.java, just use "compile_and_run.bat".

"jdk15.0.2.jdk" in compile_and_run.bat is my current Java environment, you can change it with your Java version.
